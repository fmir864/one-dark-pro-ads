# One Dark Pro theme for ADS

Based on [One Dark Pro](https://github.com/Binaryify/OneDark-Pro) theme by [Binaryify](https://github.com/Binaryify)

## Installation

Download [.vsix file](https://github.com/fmir864/one-dark-pro-ads/releases/download/v0.0.1/one-dark-pro-ads-0.0.1.vsix), open the command palette and select Extensions: Install from VSIX...

## Customization

If you are using VSCode 1.12+ versions you can customize the colors to your liking, overriding the ones provided by this theme. More info [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/theme-color-reference).

### Suggestions

The theme does not use a custom font, but we prefer to use new Microsoft open source font ['Cascadia code'](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code) with font Ligatures turn on. You can [customize your settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings) to use it.
If you download and install  the font in your system , you can add this option to have a custom font:

```json
{
    "editor.fontFamily": "'Cascadia Code PL', 'Cascadia Mono PL'"
}
```
